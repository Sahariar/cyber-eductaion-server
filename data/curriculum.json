    "description": "Have you ever wondered why your organization's executives or your manager made a decision to fund or not fund your project?In this course, you will get an inside look at how cybersecurity and information technology (IT) managers determine which projects they will support with funding, and which they won't, based on a preliminary risk analysis. Over the past two decades, I have worked in the cybersecurity and information technology realm, fighting for my projects to be funded. Early in my career, I didn't understand why certain projects would be funded and executed, while others wouldn't. What I learned, is that it all came down to Risk Management by our executives and managers.",
    "description1": "You will learn the terms used by executives and managers in discussing Risk Management, and how to apply the concepts of Risk Management to your networks, systems, and projects. This course is not an operational or tactical course that focuses on how you will secure your networks, but instead focuses on the mindset of managers and teaches you how to think like they do. Once you master these concepts, it is much easier to build your business case for your projects and justify your budgetary needs.Throughout this course, we will discuss what comprises Risk (assets, threats, and vulnerabilities), providing numerous real-world examples along the way. We will also cover Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Measurements, showing how you can calculate the risk of an uncertainty due to vulnerabilities and threats.",
    "description2": "This course also includes two case studies of what happens when risk management fails, as demonstrated by the Amazon Web Services outage and Equifax data breach that both occurred in 2017. You will learn to better understand these scenarios, what caused the outage/breach, and why managers may have made the decisions they did that led up to them.",

With no prior knowledge required this course will take you from a beginner to advanced in all of these topics; teaching you how to properly and securely discover data and websites on both the dark web and clear web, access hidden (onion) services, communicate privately and anonymously using instant messages and email, manually use end-to-end encryption to protect your privacy and make it impossible to read even if it gets intercepted, sign and verify files, share files anonymously, transfer funds anonymously using crypto currencies such as Bitcoin and Monero and much more! You'll also learn how to do all of this in a secure manner making it very difficult for hackers or other entities to hack you or de-anonymise you, and even if you get hacked these entities won't be able to easily control your system or de-anonymise you.",
    "description1": "This course is highly practical but won't neglect the theory, first you'll understand the inner-workings of each topic and each technique covered, then you'll learn how to apply it in real-life scenarios ultimately teaching you how to use the dark net and the clear net in a more private, more anonymouse and more secure manner, so by the end of the course you'll be able to combine the skills you learned and use them in any situation that requires more privacy, more anonymity or more security.",
